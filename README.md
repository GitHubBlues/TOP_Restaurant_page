## **Restaurant page**

This is my take on [Odin's Project Restaurant page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page). It consistes of a landing page, a menu page and a contact page for a ficticious restaurant "Ambrosia's Diner".

The main features of this project are:
- using webpack for bundling different assets
- advanced DOM manipulation, as all DOM elements are created with javascript
- improving the code organization by using ES6 modules
- GitHub deployment of a html file not located in the root (where Github pages expects it to be)
